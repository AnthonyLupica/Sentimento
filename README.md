# Project Description
Sentimento: A reinvented journal. Entries will be scanned and highlighted for emotive words, such as happy/sad/ etc upon submission. These will be split into percentages that comprise a mood for the day. Using RGB for each 5 emotions, a color for the day will be created. This can be tracked for the week, month, year, etc. and can help users track their moods/emotions/feelings through that time.
