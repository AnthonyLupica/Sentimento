                               be able to grow, independent of its neighboring entries. Eventually, the hope is to have to seperate flexboxes in charge of rendering entries
                               to either half of the screen. This way, it may be easier to allow entries to be how ever long they need to be, without infringing on others.
                               Sentimento: A reinvented journal. Entries will be scanned and highlighted for emotive words, such as happy/sad/ etc upon submission. These will be split 
                               into percentages that comprise a mood for the day. Using RGB for each 5 emotions, a color for the day will be created. This can be tracked for the week, month, 
                               year, etc. and can help users track their moods/emotions/feelings through that time."
