Temporary work place for testing things with the spacy library
Environment setup
Install pipenv with pip pip install pipenv
(I successfully did this with sudo apt-get install, but pipenv's website doesn't recommend it)
you may need to add pipenv to path with a command like echo 'export PATH="/path/from/error/message:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile source ~/.profile

Go to the root of our sentimento repository, run pipenv install --skip-lock
This will install all of our dependencies in one fell swoop! the "--skip-lock" option will save some time for testing purposes. when you do not --skip-lock, pipenv "locks" the pipfile, it's basically making aversion of our requirements list that will be used for release.

Once dependencies are successfully installed, run pipenv shell
This is the equivalent of "source env/bin/activate"

change into this spacy directory, and run python test.py file.txt True
where "file.txt" is a journal entry in the current directory you want to analyze The "True" or "False" flag is for whether or not you want "watered down" results or not see test.py for more details on watered down results. This is our demo so far!

to quit the pipenv shell, simply put exit
